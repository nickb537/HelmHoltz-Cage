This repository containts the design files and software for an open-source Helmholtz cage.
Presently this will require someone with some PCB design and manufacturing experience to order the boards from a source like OSHPark and solder the board. I welcome contributions to this project that improve the design or make it easier for other users to get started with less experience.

Hardware_design: Hardware files to create the PCBs
MATLAB_GUI: Matlab software to operate the cage using the GUI
microcontroller_software: Software to load onto the Teensy microcontroller to operate the HH cage electronics at a low level
